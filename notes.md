1. axes are similar to Unity 
    - x = horizontal, y = vertical, z = depth
2. Unit of measurement is in meters
_we can change the above as we like (maybe)_
3. There are Vectors in 3JS!  
4. vectors come with useful methods just as, `set`, `distanceTo`, `normalize` etc (more on docs)
5. Scaling is also simple
6. rotation: 2 ways to rotate: rotation and quternions (ah yes)
    - *rotation* is NOT a vector but an Eular, rotation is in radians.
